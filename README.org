Crux is a wallpaper manager written in Perl, currently it supports
fetching from Unsplash Source.

Support for more sources is planned, I have previously written [[https://andinus.nand.sh/cetus/][Cetus]]
which supports /Bing Photo of the Day/ & /NASA Astronomy Picture of the
Day/. I plan to port all to features to Crux too.
